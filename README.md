# THIS IS NOT MY WORK 
This library is Clans floating action button library which I have forked in order to add the ability to open menus left and right
# FloatingActionButton
Everything clans did with this library works I haven't broken anything, but I have added left and right opening,

for full details about this library, how it works, how to style it, and licences please see clans library here https://github.com/Clans/FloatingActionButton

just add it to your project like this 

implementation 'com.github.martipello:FloatingActionButton:v2.0'

and check out the examples, again all done by clans, with very slight tweak by me
